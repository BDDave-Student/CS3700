## Group Project
The project implements a group of students' designed ERD and DDL to implement a schema in order to create tables and entries to the respective table.  

The concept of the project was to act as a database to store customer/owners of dogs and the dog's respective favorite dog food.  The project evolved into also acting as a ways to store information a store might find useful; such as, invoice information and shipping addresses of customers and supplier information of dog food.
